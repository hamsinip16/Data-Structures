  # Data-Structures
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. 
It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

1. __Linear Data Structure__
   --> STATIC DATA STRUCTURES
                                       >> __Array__ [fixed memory size]

   --> DYNAMIC DATA STRUCTURES
                                       >> __Queue__ [FIFO]
                                       >> __Stack__ [LIFO]
                                       >> __Linked List__ [to implement stacks, queues, graphs]

3. __Non-Linear Data Structure__
   --> TREE 
   --> GRAPH
