  # Data-Structures
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. 
It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

1. __Linear Data Structure__ 1. STATIC DATA STRUCTURES
                                       1. Array [fixed memory size]
                             2. DYNAMIC DATA STRUCTURES
                                       1. Queue [FIFO]
                                       2. Stack [LIFO]
                                       3. Linked List [to implement stacks, queues, graphs]

2. __Non-Linear Data Structure__ --> TREE 
                                 --> GRAPH
